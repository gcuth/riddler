# riddler

A selection of solutions to puzzles posted in [Five Thirty Eight's 'Riddler' weekly column](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/).

All solutions are given as individual Jupyter notebooks and contain some version of the puzzle description. Wherever possible/relevant, I provide a conventional solution along with some kind of simulation (usually written in Julia). The naming scheme is `[date-of-publication]-[two-word-descriptor]`.

I'm a little late to *The Riddler* party, so I'm working through the back catalogue at the moment. Uncompleted puzzles are added as open issues.

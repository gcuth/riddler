# riddler

A selection of solutions to puzzles posted in [Five Thirty Eight's 'Riddler' weekly column](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/).

All solutions are given as Jupyter notebooks, and contain some version of the puzzle description. The naming scheme is `[date-of-publication]-[two-word-descriptor]`. 

I'm a little late to *The Riddler* party, so I'm working through the back catalogue at the moment. You can see my progress in chronological order in the `TODO.md` file.

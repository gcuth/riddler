# riddler

A selection of solutions to puzzles posted in [Five Thirty Eight's 'Riddler' weekly column](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/).

I'm a little late to *The Riddler* party, so I'm working through the back catalogue at the moment and treating them as programming challenges. Uncompleted puzzles are (usually) added as open issues.

All solutions are given as individual Jupyter notebooks and contain some version of the puzzle description. Wherever possible/relevant, I provide some kind of simulation. I also try to give a conventional (non-simulated) solution.

The naming scheme is `[date-of-publication]-[two-word-descriptor]`.

    "> 2. Now that we have all the calendars we could possibly need, it’d be nice to know how often we’re using them. When is the next time we’ll use the 2015 calendar?\n",

The best case gap is always one where there's only one leap year calendar between the two (non-leap-year) calendars because, rather than taking 7 years to recycle, the leap year let's you 'skip ahead' by one year. So, $6$. A good example of this is in the above table, where the 2017 calendar recycles in 2023."
